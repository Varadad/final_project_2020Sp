#The need for this project from the perspective of hospitals
COVID-19 came into this world without any warning or signs. This unannounced global pandemic was something the hospitals weren't prepared for and has called for crisis management measures. The hospitals have to make do with the available resources and make sure that there is maximum utilization of these resources to test and treat the patients that need urgent care. Our project witnesses a model called the SEIR model (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Result model) inspired from the SEIR model (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered model). In our model, the R stands for result which includes people who are recovering as well as dying from COVID-19 compared to the R in the original SEIR model which stands for just the people who have recovered. Our model considers the various aspects of COVID-19, the statistics and data related to these aspects and then simulates the possibility of hospital beds overflowing for a fixed population and a fixed number of beds for a given number of days. This can prove to be helpful for hospitals in planning, managing and foreseeing the utilization of resources in these trying times enabling the healthworkers to drive their attention towards enhancing the diagnosis of the COVID-19 patients.
